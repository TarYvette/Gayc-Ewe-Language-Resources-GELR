# Motivation of This project

Due to the fact that there is no previous work on this topic, there is no dictionary or corpus and it is just known and understand by few people but at the same there is a lot of documents unexploited, so building a Ewe resources will be frontier on this language with the implementation of the corpus and NLP platform. Our research will provide a well-supplied dataset to facilitate and encourage more language research and will benefit for both my
country and the world in terms of NLP research. It will help people to discover and understand more about Ewe language and culture.
